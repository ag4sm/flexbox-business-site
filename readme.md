# Replica of Tri-CoGo.com

This is my attempt at replicating the website of the company I work for and demonstrating my use of Flexbox.

This is not an exact duplicate nor was it intended to be that way as I don't want to copy their work.  It is just intended to show my use of Flexbox and some responsive design using media queries. The "articles" in the middle are just screenshots and are there just to show use of Flexbox.

For the website I copied, visit https://tri-cogo.com.
